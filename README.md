# POINTERS
Pointers are variables that hold the address to other variables. The & sign is used to "fetch" the address of the variable at that memory location. The * operator accesses the value of an address. Pointers are helpful in recursion by making a function go back to itself.

SYNTAX
int *p;    pointer of integer type is created to point at variable p
x = &p;    x is a value stored at the address of p
